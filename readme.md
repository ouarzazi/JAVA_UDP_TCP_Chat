# TCP_UDP_Chat Project

This project is a network communication using UDP and TCP protocols. It includes both server and client implementations for both UDP and TCP, along with a multi-threaded TCP server.

## Project Structure

- `UDPServer`: UDP server implementation.
- `UDPClient`: UDP client implementation.
- `TCPServer`: TCP server implementation.
- `TCPClient`: TCP client implementation.
- `ThreadTest`: A test program for multithreading.
- `ConnectionThread`: A thread class used by TCPMultiServer.
- `TCPMultiServer`: Implementation of TCP server that supports multiple clients.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for building and running the project.
